### The intention
I want to try a small weekly challenge to improve my skills in Godot and video games. I'll try to upload what I create on itch.io and here too. Hopefully it works out - these things usually end up in nothing, but I'll try to upload what I can.

The assets will most likely be free to use, or polygons depending on the situation.

Let's see how it goes.

### Challenges

I'll leave a copy of what I want to do in case anyone wants to follow along.
